### Introduction

Talking Head (3D) is a JavaScript class featuring a 3D avatar that can
speak and lip-sync in real-time. The class supports
[Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/) full-body 3D avatars (GLB),
[Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com) animations (FBX), markdown text, and subtitles.
It also knows a set of emojis, which it can convert into facial expressions.

By default, the class uses
[Google Cloud TTS](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech) for text-to-speech
and has a built-in lip-sync support for English, Finnish, and Lithuanian (beta).
New lip-sync languages can be added by creating new lip-sync language modules.
It is also possible to integrate the class with an external TTS service, such as
[Microsoft Azure Speech SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js),
which can provide visemes with timestamps.

The class uses [ThreeJS](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) / WebGL for 3D
rendering, and [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) Markdown parser.

### Talking Head class

You can download the TalkingHead modules from
[releases](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead/releases)
(without dependencies). Alternatively, you can import all the needed
modules from a CDN:

```javascript
<script type="importmap">
{ "imports":
  {
    "three": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.161.0/build/three.module.js/+esm",
    "three/examples/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.161.0/examples/",
    "three/addons/": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.161.0/examples/jsm/",
    "dompurify": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dompurify@3.0.6/+esm",
    "marked": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked@11.2.0/+esm",
    "talkinghead": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/met4citizen/TalkingHead@1.1/modules/talkinghead.mjs"
  }
}
</script>
```

If you want to use the built-in Google TTS and lip-sync using
Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality, give the class your TTS proxy endpoint and
a function from which to obtain the JSON Web Token needed to use that proxy.
Refer to Appendix B for one way to implement JWT SSO.

```javascript
import { TalkingHead } from "talkinghead";

// Create the talking head avatar
const nodeAvatar = document.getElementById('avatar');
const head = new TalkingHead( nodeAvatar, {
  ttsEndpoint: "/gtts/",
  jwtGet: jwtGet
});
```

**FOR HOBBYISTS:** If you're just looking to experiment on your personal
laptop without dealing with proxies, JSON Web Tokens, or Single Sign-On,
take a look at the [minimal code example](https://github.com/met4citizen/TalkingHead/blob/main/examples/minimal.html).
Simply download the file, add your Google TTS API key, and you'll
have a basic web app with a talking head.

The following table lists all the available options and their default values:

Once the instance has been created, you can load and display your avatar.
Refer to Appendix A for how to make your avatar:

```javascript
// Load and show the avatar
try {
  await head.showAvatar( {
    url: './avatars/brunette.glb',
    body: 'F',
    avatarMood: 'neutral',
    ttsLang: "en-GB",
    ttsVoice: "en-GB-Standard-A",
    lipsyncLang: 'en'
  });
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

An example of how to make the avatar speak the text on input `text` when
the button `speak` is clicked:

```javascript
// Speak 'text' when the button 'speak' is clicked
const nodeSpeak = document.getElementById('speak');
nodeSpeak.addEventListener('click', function () {
  try {
    const text = document.getElementById('text').value;
    if ( text ) {
      head.speakText( text );
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
});
```

The following table lists some of the key methods. See the source code for the rest:

Method | Description
--- | ---
`showAvatar(avatar, [onprogress=null])` | Load and show the specified avatar. The `avatar` object must include the `url` for GLB file. Optional properties are `body` for either male `M` or female `F` body form, `lipsyncLang`, `ttsLang`, `ttsVoice`, `ttsRate`, `ttsPitch`, `ttsVolume`, `avatarMood` and `avatarMute`.
`setView(view, [opt])` | Set view. Supported views are `"full"`, `"mid"`, `"upper"`  and `"head"`. The `opt` object can be used to set `cameraDistance`, `cameraX`, `cameraY`, `cameraRotateX`, `cameraRotateY`.
`setLighting(opt)` | Change lighting settings. The `opt` object can be used to set `lightAmbientColor`, `lightAmbientIntensity`, `lightDirectColor`, `lightDirectIntensity`, `lightDirectPhi`, `lightDirectTheta`, `lightSpotColor`, `lightSpotIntensity`, `lightSpotPhi`, `lightSpotTheta`, `lightSpotDispersion`.
`speakText(text, [opt={}], [onsubtitles=null], [excludes=[]])` | Add the `text` string to the speech queue. The text can contain face emojis. Options `opt` can be used to set text-specific `lipsyncLang`, `ttsLang`, `ttsVoice`, `ttsRate`, `ttsPitch`, `ttsVolume`, `avatarMood`, `avatarMute`. Optional callback function `onsubtitles` is called whenever a new subtitle is to be written with the parameter of the added string. The optional `excludes` is an array of [start,end] indices to be excluded from audio but to be included in the subtitles.
`speakAudio(audio, [opt={}], [onsubtitles=null])` | Add a new `audio` object to the speech queue. This method was added to support external TTS services such as ElevenLabs and Azure, but can be user. In audio object, property `audio` is either `AudioBuffer` or an array of PCM 16bit LE audio chunks. Property `words` is an array of words, `wtimes` is an array of corresponding starting times in milliseconds, and `wdurations` an array of durations in milliseconds. If the Oculus viseme IDs are know, they can be given in optional `visemes`, `vtimes` and `vdurations` arrays. The object also supports optional timed callbacks using `markers` and `mtimes`. The `opt` object can be used to set text-specific `lipsyncLang`.
`speakEmoji(e)` | Add an emoji `e` to the speech queue.
`speakBreak(t)` | Add a break of `t` milliseconds to the speech queue.
`speakMarker(onmarker)` | Add a marker to the speech queue. The callback function `onmarker` is called when the queue processes the event.
`lookAt(x,y,t)` | Make the avatar's head turn to look at the screen position (`x`,`y`) for `t` milliseconds.
`lookAtCamera(t)` | Make the avatar's head turn to look at the camera for `t` milliseconds.
`setMood(mood)` | Set avatar mood.
`playBackgroundAudio(url)` | Play background audio such as ambient sounds/music in a loop.
`stopBackgroundAudio()` | Stop playing the background audio.
`playAnimation(url, [onprogress=null], [dur=10], [ndx=0], [scale=0.01])` | Play Mixamo animation file for `dur` seconds, but full rounds and at least once. If the FBX file includes several animations, the parameter `ndx` specifies the index. Since Mixamo rigs have a scale 100 and RPM a scale 1, the `scale` factor can be used to scale the positions.
`stopAnimation()` | Stop the current animation started by `playAnimation`.
`playPose(url, [onprogress=null], [dur=5], [ndx=0], [scale=0.01])` | Play the initial pose of a Mixamo animation file for `dur` seconds. If the FBX file includes several animations, the parameter `ndx` specifies the index. Since Mixamo rigs have a scale 100 and RPM a scale 1, the `scale` factor can be used to scale the positions.
`stopPose()` | Stop the current pose started by `playPose`.
`start` | Start/re-start the Talking Head animation loop.
`stop` | Stop the Talking Head animation loop.

### The `index.html` App

**NOTE:** *The `index.html` app was initially created for testing and developing
the TalkingHead class. It includes various integrations with several paid
services. If you only want to use the TalkingHead class in your own app,
there is no need to install and configure the `index.html` app.*

The web app `index.html` shows how to integrate and use
the class with [ElevenLabs WebSocket API](https://elevenlabs.io) (experimental),
[Microsoft Azure Speech SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/cognitive-services-speech-sdk-js),
[OpenAI API](https://openai.com) and
[Gemini Pro API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai).

You can preview the app's UI [here](https://met4citizen.github.io/TalkingHead/).
Please note that since the API proxies for the text-to-speech and
AI services are missing, the avatar does not speak or lip-sync, and
you can't chat with it.

If you want to configure and use the app `index.html`, do the following:

1. Copy the whole project to your own server.

2. Create the needed API proxies as described in Appendix B and check/update your endpoint/proxy configuration in `index.html`:

```javascript
// API endpoints/proxys
const jwtEndpoint = "/app/jwt/get"; // Get JSON Web Token for Single Sign-On
const openaiChatCompletionsProxy = "/openai/v1/chat/completions";
const openaiModerationsProxy = "/openai/v1/moderations";
const openaiAudioTranscriptionsProxy = "/openai/v1/audio/transcriptions";
const vertexaiChatCompletionsProxy = "/vertexai/";
const googleTTSProxy = "/gtts/";
const elevenTTSProxy = [
  "wss://" + window.location.host + "/elevenlabs/",
  "/v1/text-to-speech/",
  "/stream-input?model_id=eleven_multilingual_v2&output_format=pcm_22050"
];
const microsoftTTSProxy = [
  "wss://" + window.location.host + "/mstts/",
  "/cognitiveservices/websocket/v1"
];
```

3. The example app's UI supports both Finnish and English. If you want to add another language, you need to add an another entry to the `i18n` object.

4. Add you own background images, videos, audio files, avatars etc. in the directory structure and update your site configuration `siteconfig.js` accordingly. The keys are in English, but the entries can include translations to other languages.

### FAQ

**Why not use the free Web Speech API?**

The free Web Speech API can't provide word-to-audio timestamps, which are
essential for accurate lip-sync. As far as I know, there is no way even to
get Web Speech API speech synthesis as an audio file or determine its
duration in advance. At some point I tried to use the Web Speech API
events for syncronization, but the results were not good.

**What paid text-to-speech service should I use?**

It depends on your use case and budget. If the built-in lip-sync support
is sufficient for your needs, I would recommend Google TTS, because
it gives you up to 4 million characters for free each month. If your
app needs to support multiple languages, I would consider Microsoft
Speech SDK.

**I would like to have lip-sync support for language X.**

You have two options. First, you can implement a word-to-viseme
class similar to those that currently exist for English and Finnish.
See Appendix C for detailed instructions.
Alternatively, you can check if Microsoft Azure TTS can provide visemes
for your language and use Microsoft Speech SDK integration (`speakAudio`)
instead of Google TTS and the built-in lip-sync (`speakText`).

**Can I use a custom 3D model?**

The class supports full-body Ready Player Me avatars. You can also make your
own custom model, but it needs to have a RPM compatible rig/bone structure
and all their blend shapes. Please refer to Appendix A and readyplayer.me
documentation for more details.

**Any future plans for the project?**

This is just a small side-project for me, so I don't have any big
plans for it. That said, there are several companies that are currently
developing text-to-3D-avatar and text-to-3D-animation features. If and
when they get released as APIs, I will probably take a look at them and see
if they can be used/integrated in some way to the project.

### Appendix A: Create Your Own 3D Avatar

**FOR HOBBYISTS:**

1. Create your own full-body avatar free at [https://readyplayer.me](https://readyplayer.me)

2. Copy the given URL and add the following URL parameters in order to include all the needed morph targets:<br>`morphTargets=ARKit,Oculus+Visemes,mouthOpen,mouthSmile,eyesClosed,eyesLookUp,eyesLookDown&textureSizeLimit=1024&textureFormat=png`<br><br>Your final URL should look something like this:<br>`https://models.readyplayer.me/64bfa15f0e72c63d7c3934a6.glb?morphTargets=ARKit,Oculus+Visemes,mouthOpen,mouthSmile,eyesClosed,eyesLookUp,eyesLookDown&textureSizeLimit=1024&textureFormat=png`

3. Use the URL to download the GLB file to your own web server.

**FOR 3D MODELERS:**

You can create and use your own 3D full-body model, but it has to be
Ready Player Me compatible. Their rig has a Mixamo-compatible bone
structure described here:

https://docs.readyplayer.me/ready-player-me/api-reference/avatars/full-body-avatars

For lip-sync and facial expressions, you also need to have ARKit and Oculus
compatible blend shapes, and a few additional ones, all listed in the
following two pages:

https://docs.readyplayer.me/ready-player-me/api-reference/avatars/morph-targets/apple-arkit
https://docs.readyplayer.me/ready-player-me/api-reference/avatars/morph-targets/oculus-ovr-libsync

The TalkingHead class supports both separated mesh and texture atlasing.

### Appendix B: Create API Proxies with JSON Web Token (JWT) Single Sign-On (SSO)

1. Make a CGI script that generates a new JSON Web Token with an expiration time (exp). See [jwt.io](https://jwt.io) for more information about JWT and libraries that best fit your needs and architecture.

2. Protect your CGI script with some authentication scheme. Below is an example Apache 2.4 directory config that uses Basic authentication (remember to always use HTTPS/SSL!). Put your CGI script `get` in the `jwt` directory.

```apacheconf
# Restricted applications
<Directory "/var/www/app">
  AuthType Basic
  AuthName "Restricted apps"
  AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/.htpasswd
  Require valid-user
</Directory>

# JSON Web Token
<Directory "/var/www/app/jwt" >
  Options ExecCGI
  SetEnv REMOTE_USER %{REMOTE_USER}
  SetHandler cgi-script
</Directory>
```

3. Make an [External Rewriting Program](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/rewritemap.html#prg) script that verifies JSON Web Tokens. The script should return `OK` if the given token is not expired and its signature is valid. Start the script in Apache 2.4 config. User's don't use the verifier script directly, so put it in some internal directory, not under document root.

```apacheconf
# JSON Web Token verifier
RewriteEngine On
RewriteMap jwtverify "prg:/etc/httpd/jwtverify" apache:apache
```

4. Make a proxy configuration for each service you want to use. Add the required API keys and protect the proxies with the JWT token verifier. Below are some example configs for Apache 2.4 web server. Note that when opening a WebSocket connection (ElevenLabs, Azure) you can't add authentication headers in browser JavaScript. This problem is solved here by including the JWT token as a part of the request URL. The downside is that the token might end up in server log files. This is typically not a problem as long as you are controlling the proxy server, you are using HTTPS/SSL, and the token has an expiration time.


```apacheconf
# OpenAI API
<Location /openai/>
  RewriteCond ${jwtverify:%{http:Authorization}} !=OK
  RewriteRule .+ - [F]
  ProxyPass https://api.openai.com/
  ProxyPassReverse  https://api.openai.com/
  ProxyPassReverseCookiePath "/"  "/openai/"

### Appendix C: Create A New Lip-sync Module

The steps that are common to all new languages:

- Create a new file named `lipsync-xx.mjs` where `xx` is your language code, and place the file in the `./modules/` directory. The language module should have a class named `LipsyncXx` where Xx is the language code.
- The class should have (at least) the following two methods: `preProcessText` and `wordsToVisemes`. These are the methods used in the TalkingHead class.
- The purpose of the `preProcessText` method is to preprocess the given text by converting symbols to words, numbers to words, and filtering out characters that should be left unspoken (if any), etc. This is often needed to prevent ambiguities between TTS and lip-sync engines. This method takes a string as a parameter and returns the preprocessed string.
- The purpose of the `wordsToVisemes` method is to convert the given text into visemes and timestamps. The method takes a string as a parameter and returns a lip-sync object. The lipsync object has three required properties: `visemes`, `times`and `durations`.
  - Property `visemes` is an array of Oculus OVR viseme codes. Each viseme is one of the strings: 'aa', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'PP', 'SS', 'TH', 'CH', 'FF', 'kk', 'nn', 'RR', 'DD', 'sil'. See the reference images here: https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/audio-ovrlipsync-viseme-reference/
  - Property `times` is an array of starting times, one entry for each viseme in `visemes`. Starting times are to be given in relative units. They are always scaled according to the word timestamps that we get from the TTS engine.
  - Property `durations` is an array of relative duration in milliseconds, one entry for each viseme in `visemes`. Durations are to be given in relative units. They are always scaled according to the word timestamps that we get from the TTS engine.
- Import the new lip-sync implementation file into the `talkinghead.mjs` file, for example, `import { LipsyncXx } from './lipsync-xx.mjs';` and add a new entry `this.lipsync` in the constructor, for example, `'xx': new LipsyncXx()`.

The difficult part is to actually make the conversion from words to visemes.
What is the best approach depends on the language. Here are some typical
approaches to consider (not a comprehensive list):

- **Direct mapping from graphemes to phonemes to visemes**. This works well for languages that have a consistent one-to-one mapping between individual letters and phonemes. This was used as the approach for the Finnish language (`lipsync-fi.mjs`) giving >99.9% lip-sync accuracy compared to the Finnish phoneme dictionary. Implementation size was ~4k. Unfortunately not all languages are phonetically orthographic languages.
- **Rule-based mapping**. This was used as the approach for the English language (`lipsync-en.mjs`) giving around 80% lip-sync accuracy compared to the English phoneme dictionary. However, since the rules cover the most common words, the effective accuracy is higher. Implementation size ~12k.
- Dictionary based approach. If neither of the previous approaches work for your language, make a search from some open source phoneme dictionary. Note that you still need some backup algorithm for those words that are not in the dictionary. The problem with phoneme dictionaries is their size. For example, the CMU phoneme dictionary for English is ~5M.
- **Neural-net approach based on transformer models**. Typically this should be done on server-side as the model side can be >50M.

TalkingHead is supposed to be a real-time class, so latency is
always something to consider. It is often better to be small and fast than
to aim for 100% accuracy.
